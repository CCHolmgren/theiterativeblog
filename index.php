			<span>Changes since last post: miniscule.</span>
		</header>
		<div>
			<p>My intention is for all changes to be documented here. This means that even small or even miniscule changes will end up in a post, in it's own or in one documenting several such changes.</p>
			<p>With all changes being documented, there might be a need for them to be categorized some way. If you're only interested in the large ones, then a miniscule change might not be of interest. That's why I added the "Changes since last post" "tag" to the header of every post. It is a very subjective categorization, not based on anything other than what I think that it should be called, subjectivity is all around us, embrace it.</p>
			<p>I also changed the blog header, I added the "among other things" part. Sometime in the future, when it is necessary, this header might include more things, but this will suffice for now.</p>

			<h2>An update on the last post</h2>

			<span>Changes since last post: small.</span>

		<div>
			<p>I forgot to mention some things in the last post, that I think are important to this whole picture.</p>
			<p>Since this is <i>The Iterative Blog</i>, I will keep iterating on both blog posts, and the layout, structure and everything in between. I will try to improve on everything that I can improve on. To do this I will use different tools, such as the W3C HTML Validator, PageSpeed, and other tools to measure and quantify what there is to be improved, and what works well.</p>
			<p>In the beginning I will not include anything that isn't strictly necessary, no jQuery, no Foundation or Bootstrap, no Googly Analytics, nothing. However, some of these might come in handy later on, and I might use them if I deem them to be a net positive.</p>
			<p>Since the last post I ran the W3C Validator and have changed some tiny things that it did not agree on. This is to avoid all of the problems that improper markup can have on the page. If the goal is to have a great product, every part of it must be great, not just the visual, the content or the backend.</p>
			<p>This is the first blog that I have some kind of goal with, I've had other before but none of them save any kind of long lived commitment, so this time I might be able to keep this up a little longer. It will also be a great way to improve my written english.</p>

			<h2>Baby steps towards something new</h2>

			<span>Changes since last post: groundbreaking.</span>
		</header>
		<div>
			<p>The intention with this blog is to document the development of a platform, or something of that effect, for blogging. 
				It will strive to be as close as possible to the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), without any bloat or feature creep. 
				What I mean with that is that no feature will be added, unless it is needed at that moment, nothing will be loaded, unless it is necessary for a better product, a better blogging experience or a better use experience.
			</p>
			<p>This project aims to be a challenge for me: limiting which features I include in my projects. As a developer it is very easy to let the features pile on, until you got something that is many many times greater than what you imagined from the beginning. I find that adding a lot of features to the todo list makes it a lot harder just to finish one of the items. So this will be a challenge to do the opposite, limit them as much as possible. <br>
				What I hope that this will mean for me in the long run is a better focus on the main problem that I am trying to solve, instead of growing the project in size and difficulty without any real use.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this moment, there is nothing but a very basic html page here. Nothing dynamic, no CSS, no Javascript, nothing like that. In the end, I hope to end up with a product; where I can easily publish a blogpost, where I do not have to write all the actual html by hand, that looks good, that is responsive, that loads fast and everything else that you would hope every page would have.
			</p>
			<p>I hope that I do not end up with bloat, slow loading or anything other negative.</p>
