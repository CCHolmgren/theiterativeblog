{"title":"Baby steps towards something new","published":"2016-11-16 19:22","changes":"ground breaking","write_time":"28 minutes","content":"<p>The intention with this blog is to document the development of a platform, or something of that effect, for blogging. \r\n\t\t\t\tIt will strive to be as close as possible to the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), without any bloat or feature creep. \r\n\t\t\t\tWhat I mean with that is that no feature will be added, unless it is needed at that moment, nothing will be loaded, unless it is necessary for a better product, a better blogging experience or a better use experience.\r\n\t\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>This project aims to be a challenge for me: limiting which features I include in my projects. As a developer it is very easy to let the features pile on, until you got something that is many many times greater than what you imagined from the beginning. I find that adding a lot of features to the todo list makes it a lot harder just to finish one of the items. So this will be a challenge to do the opposite, limit them as much as possible. <br>\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat I hope that this will mean for me in the long run is a better focus on the main problem that I am trying to solve, instead of growing the project in size and difficulty without any real use.\r\n\t\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tAt this moment, there is nothing but a very basic html page here. Nothing dynamic, no CSS, no Javascript, nothing like that. In the end, I hope to end up with a product; where I can easily publish a blogpost, where I do not have to write all the actual html by hand, that looks good, that is responsive, that loads fast and everything else that you would hope every page would have.\r\n\t\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I hope that I do not end up with bloat, slow loading or anything other negative.<\/p>","name":"1479408996"}
