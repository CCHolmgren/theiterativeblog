{"title":"Usability: improved!","published":"2016-11-23 22:00","changes":"small","write_time":"12 minutes","content":"<p>Small but noticeable change for me!<\/p>\r\n<p>Instead of blindly reloading the page, which is extremely quick to do, since nothing is really loading, the form will now prevent reloads of you have focused it sometime since the last page load. This way you should not be able to accidentally reload the page and lose changes that you so desperately wanted to do. It is a very blunt way of doing it, but it works, it is easy, and there should not be any profound problems with it. The whole Javascript file is just a few lines long (a total of 261 characters, with nothing minified, gziped or optimized in any way), and should not affect the load time in some way that you can notice (we are talking about the smallest possible script here).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the todo things done, infinitely many things to go!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edit: I changed it so that if you submit the form you will not have to actually click \"Leave\" on the popup that your browser shows. Having to click something when you actively submit the form is just unnecessary, and bad ux.<\/p>","name":"1479939131"}
