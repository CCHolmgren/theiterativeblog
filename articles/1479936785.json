I will probably fix a domain name sometime in the future, but at this moment a raw ip will suffice.<\/p>\r\n<p>Regarding deployment. Deployment is just a breeze when you use git, and can just do a quick <code>git clone<\/code> to get everything to production. It is running on it's own DigitalOcean droplet, so I just had to install nginx and php, configure nginx, do a git clone and it was live!<\/p>\r\n<p>What I have noticed is that if I ever publish an article on the live site, it will create the file on the server, but not on my development box, which means that I first have to do a <code>git commit<\/code> before I <code>git pull<\/code>, which is really annoying. Having to do that on the production server is not something that you should ever have to do. So what I am thinking is to migrate to some kind of database solution, so that I do not have my articles saved in the repository. To do that means that I will have change some code, move the articles and so on, which means changes that might not be necessary. What the actual solution will be, will have to be seen.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since my development machine is a development environment, it would make more sense to not have the articles there, and just have the articles in the production environment. The question then becomes, how do I make sure that they are backed up, so that I do not lose them in case of some problem with my server?<\/p>","name":"1479936785"}
