This means that even small or even miniscule changes will end up in a post, in it's own or in one documenting several such changes.<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>With all changes being documented, there might be a need for them to be categorized some way. If you're only interested in the large ones, then a miniscule change might not be of interest. That's why I added the \"Changes since last post\" \"tag\" to the header of every post. It is a very subjective categorization, not based on anything other than what I think that it should be called, subjectivity is all around us, embrace it.<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>I also changed the blog header, I added the \"among other things\" part. Sometime in the future, when it is necessary, this header might include more things, but this will suffice for now.<\/p>","name":"1479409090"}
