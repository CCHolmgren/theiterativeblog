It's annoying to lose content because you accidentally refreshed the page.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Automatic time to write calculation, either by calculating the offset from the \"published\" box, or by using a Javascript to count how long it took to submit the form. Maybe there could be a way to either write a time, or it uses the calculated time?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The index.php file is located in the \/public\/ directory. This is where everything that should be public (duh!) is located, but nothing that is private. Having to always refer to the directory below it to reference every file that is needed is quite error prone (i.e. forget to change a filename and everything breaks sometime in the future). Instead of doing that, just load some other file in the parent directory, and do nothing else in the index.php file to avoid such silly mistakes. Sounds sane enough, right?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>","name":"1479735774"}
