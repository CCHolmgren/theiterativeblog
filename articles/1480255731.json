{"title":"The proof is in the styling","published":"2016-11-27 14:08","changes":"stylistically significant","write_time":"30 minutes","content":"<p>Some very basic styling is now added. Very little got added, I tried to keep it as lean as possible. However, I did include <code>normalize.css<\/code>, as a way to not have to deal with browsers stuck in the stone age. Having to combat different browser stylings is just horrible, so to include <code>normalize.css<\/code> is a very small price to pay.<\/p>\r\n<p>The page also got a sidebar instead of the footer that was the before. I took a very large amount of inspiration from <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.codinghorror.com\/\">codinghorror<\/a>, since it's a very clean and nice look, with very little unnecessary things added. I might refine the look later, but at the moment most of the things that I want is here. Works on small screens, still readable on larger ones, doesn't get totally absurd on huge ones.<\/p>\r\n<p>I also took the time to add templates for <code>\/new-article<\/code> and <code>\/login<\/code>, and removed the forms from the base template. That way there is no forms clogging the view, and I can still use them when I need them.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the cherry on top I also refined the <code>view()<\/code> helper so that I do not need to call it with <code>.\/view<\/code> and <code>.php<\/code>, since those are always needed. It's the details that makes it nice to use.<\/p>\r\n<p>There is a new <code>Request::getMethod()<\/code> method, which I am using to check if the forms are actually posted. Before you could just do a get-request to the urls and it would still do the action. Now it either performs the posting, or presents you with the before metioned templates.<\/p>","name":1480255731}
